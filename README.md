This project using the Python libraries like BeautifulSoup, Splinter, Pandas, and Matplotlib to scrape data from a website and perform data analysis.

## Dependencies and Setup

## Description

The script first visits a website using Splinter and creates a BeautifulSoup object to parse the webpage. It then uses BeautifulSoup to find and extract data from the HTML.

The extracted data is stored in a Pandas DataFrame, which is then used for data analysis. The script also changes the data types of the DataFrame columns as necessary for the analysis.

Finally, it uses Matplotlib to create plots for visualizing the analyzed data.
